Creating a 3x3 macro keyboard:)
Hello world! I am hoping to sooner or later make a 16 x 8 macro keyboard to use with ETC's EOSnomad software, cmd-key already makes these but they're pretty expensive and I feel like it'd be alot more fun to trial a small macro before moving onto the big boi 125 key. This projects going to require alot of me, from more than basic electronics and code writing to being able to fully CAD a case, so I'll have to use all my blood, sweat and tears in the world(mostly tears)
